## Key Takeaways
* Command Development
* CommandBox Modules & Dependency Injection
* CommandBox Ecosystem

In this repo/presentation we'll study a Choose Your Own Adventure game built as a CommandBox module to showcase how to develop command line utilities using CommandBox.  We'll start out with a simple hello world type demo and tack on cool features as we progress from demo 00 to 07.

Full CommandBox documentation can be found at https://commandbox.ortusbooks.com/developing-for-commandbox and the modules used in these demos can be found at https://forgebox.io/.
