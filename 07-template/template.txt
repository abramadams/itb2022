This is a template made just for ${name}. The placeholders in this document will be replaced with environment variable values such as the "color" variable which is currently set to ${color}.  It will also recieve data from other sources that live within CommandBox's systemSettings.  For example the itb2022.hi variable is currently set to ${itb2022.hi} and the date/time is ${now}.
